    <section name="RMIIO Class Reference">
      <p>
        The large number of classes in the RMIIO package may initially be a
        bit daunting.  The reference below describes the primary classes that
        users of this library will likely use.
      </p>

      <subsection name="RemoteInputStream">

        <p>
          Probably the first class anyone will use from RMIIO is a
          RemoteInputStream.  When a RemoteInputStream is utilized to move
          data across the network, it is essentially using a pull based
          approach, as the consumer of the stream pulls the data from the
          producer.  The actual implementations are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="apidocs/com/healthmarketscience/rmiio/SimpleRemoteInputStream.html">SimpleRemoteInputStream</a>
              - RemoteInputStream implementation which does not use any
              compression on the wire.  This may be useful if the client and
              server are on the same box, or network bandwidth is not an
              issue.
          </li>
          <li><a href="apidocs/com/healthmarketscience/rmiio/GZIPRemoteInputStream.html">GZIPRemoteInputStream</a>
              - RemoteInputStream implementation which uses GZIP compression
              over the wire.  For moving data of any non-trivial size, this
              is probably the preferred implementation.  Note that it does
              trade off some extra CPU usage on the client and server for
              the reduction in network bandwidth.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This sequence diagram shows the major interactions between a client
          and server when the client initiates a call
          (<code>sendStream</code>) to the server which includes a
          RemoteInputStream.  Note that the "Client" and "Server" objects are
          named based on who initiates the RPC interaction, but that the
          actual RPC calls go both ways.

      <subsection name="RemoteOutputStream">

        <p>
          A RemoteOutputStream turns the tables with respect to a
          RemoteInputStream, as it is essentially uses a push based approach.
          The producer of the data pushes the data to the consumer.  The
          actual implementations are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="apidocs/com/healthmarketscience/rmiio/SimpleRemoteOutputStream.html">SimpleRemoteOutputStream</a>

              compression on the wire.  This may be useful if the client and
              server are on the same box, or network bandwidth is not an
